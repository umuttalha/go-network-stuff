# network practices with golang

Contains:

    1- http-client

    2- websocket chat 
    
    3- dns provider detect( you give domain name and detect from ip which cloud provider they are using) 

    4- echo server with custom things like detect if there is spesific(umut) word in every sentences we send

    5- proxy server. this is like request first goes to the proxy server, which then forwards it to the target server. we can rent multiple ip's and make ddos but this is bad.
